#Prints a little story about a mouse and a cookie

print("If you give a mouse a cookie, he's going to ask for a glass of milk.")
print("When you give him the milk, he'll probably ask you for a straw.")
print("When he's finished, he'll ask you for a napkin.")
print("Then he'll want to look in a mirror to make sure he doesn't have a milk mustache.")
print("When he looks in the mirror, he might notice his hair needs a trim.")
print("So he'll probably ask for a pair of nail scissors.")
print("When he's finished giving himself a trim, he'll want a broom to sweep it up.")
print("He'll start sweeping. He might get carried away and sweep every room in the house.")
print("He may even end up washing the floors as well!")
